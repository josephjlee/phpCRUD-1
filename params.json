It is fast, simple, easy, efficient, yet powerful.\r\n\r\n###What is this?\r\nphpCRUD is a developer tool that reduces your time by automatically generating web forms for you from mySQL server.\r\n\r\n###Why should I use it?\r\nTime is critical. So save it by automatically generating web pages with cleanly formatted forms. It is optimized for W3C ( HTML5 and CSS3).\r\n\r\n### How to ...?\r\n1. Enter Database details (Such as Server Address, etc.) and 'Connect'.\r\n2. Select the tables you want to generate (All are selected by default).\r\n3. Click on 'Generate'.\r\n\r\n### And then?\r\nAnd... that's it. All the web pages will be generated in accordance with the tables for you on the same directory. All generated files are auto-formatted and optimized for W3C. \r\n\r\n### But how to set this up? Do I need to  install it somewhere?\r\nThis is a php tool(simply, php files). So you need to have a working apache, php and mySQL installed on your machine. If you are using Windows, I recommend WAMP. just put the **DEBUG** or **RELEASE** directory inside a 'www' or 'htdocs' or whatever folder you are having for your apache. And Run it from your browser hitting the localhost.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nInitial release is by Abhishek Deb(@vikz91) as of Dec 2012.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with phpCRUD? or having more suggestions or feature request for phpCRUD? contact at vikz91.deb@gmail.com","note":"Don't delete this file!
