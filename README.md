=======

phpCRUD is a standalone Web Form Generator. It is fast, simple, easy, efficient, yet powerful.

Q. What is this?
A. phpCRUD is a developer tool that reduces your time by automatically generating web forms for you from mySQL server.

Q. Why should I use it?
A. Time is critical. So save it by automatically generating web pages with cleanly formatted forms. It is optimized for W3C ( HTML5 and CSS3).

Q. How to ...?
1. Enter Database details (Such as Server Address, etc.) and 'Connect'.
2. Select the tables you want to generate (All are selected by default).
3. Click on 'Generate'.

Q. And then?
A. And... that's it. All the web pages will be generated in accordance with the tables for you on the same directory. All generated files are auto-formatted and optimized for W3C. 

Q. But how to set this up? Do I need to  install it somewhere?
A. This is a php tool(simply, php files). So you need to have a working apache, php and mySQL installed on your machine. If you are using Windows, I recommend WAMP. just put the **DEBUG** or **RELEASE** directory inside a 'www' or 'htdocs' or whatever folder you are having for your apache. And Run it from your browser hitting the localhost.
